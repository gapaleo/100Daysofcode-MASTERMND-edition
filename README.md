# 100 days of Code! - MASTERMND Edition

[100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is challenge designed to help you accelerate your familiarity and proficiency with code through consistency.

The original challenge has the following 2 requirements:

1. Commit to coding a minimum of 1 hour a day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet your progress everyday with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

While this challenge is great, it's a tough one for people to finish. Missing a single day can halt your momentum and make you feel like the entire challenge is ruined. 100 days is a long time and I can guarantee during that time, life will find a way to intervene somehow. 

## A Better Way...Hopefully

The MASTERMND Edition of 100DoC adds a few modifications to help extract the most out of the challenge. Here are the rules.

1. Practice/Learn for a MINUMUM of 7 hours per week for 20 weeks
2. You get 2 cheat days per week, guilt free
3. Cheat days are use or lose. You can't save them to use later(Consistency is key. We're going for 5 days a week, hands on keyboard)
4. 1 hour each week should be spent reading/analyzing code(maybe start by sharing with each other!)
5. Affirmations of Progress required weekly, but can be as often as you'd like.Your weekly update should include:
- #MASTERMNDCodeChallenge hashtag
- A short description of what you learned/attempted/completed

## Acountability

Accountability will be key in your ability to complete this challenge. Some can be accountable to themselves, most can't! Let people know what your doing! Let them know you need their encouragement, and if possible find people to go on this journey with you!
