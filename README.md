# 100 days of Code! - MASTERMND Edition

[100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is challenge designed to help you accelerate your familiarity and proficiency with code by doing.

The original challenge has the following 2 requirements:

1. Commit to coding a minimum of 1 hour a day for the next 100 days
2. Tweet your progress everyday with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

While this challenge is great, it's a tough one for people to finish. Missing a single day can halt your momentum and make you feel like the entire challenge is ruined. 100 days is a long time and I can guarantee during that time, life will find a way to intervene somehow.
